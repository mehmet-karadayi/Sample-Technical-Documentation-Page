                        <p> &emsp; Java is a <strong>class-based</strong>, <strong>Object-oriented</strong> programming
                            language (OOP). It was designed to be a <strong>
                                high-level</strong>, <strong>general-purpose</strong> language to allow developers to
                            run
                            Java code without the need for recompilation
                            on all platforms that support Java. Java syntax is similar to that of C++ and C#. However,
                            Java
                            requires less low-level facilities than the previously
                            mentioned languages.
                        </p>
                        <p> &emsp; Java was first developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995 and different
                            updated versions have been released ever since. The
                            latest version, Java SE 15, was released on September 15, 2020. Java's portability as a
                            language
                            made it immensely popular amongst developers. The ability to run
                            Java code on different machines with ony few or no changes to the code catapulted Java to
                            become
                            one most powerful programming language out there today.

                        <p> &emsp; One of the first programs that a beginner learning a new language is introduced to is
                            called the <strong>Hello World</strong> program. The purpose of this program is to
                            introduce some of the syntax of Java. The resulting output of this program is a simple
                            message
                            that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen. The program is written as follows:
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="code-div">
                        <code>
                            public class Hello {<br/>
                                &ensp; public static void main(String[] args){<br/>
                                &ensp; &emsp; //Generates the output to the screen<br/>
                                &ensp; &emsp; System.out.println("Hello, World!");<br/>
                                &ensp; }<br/>
                            }
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p> &emsp; When we compile and run this program the output we see on on the screen is:</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="code-output">
                        <code>Hello, World!</code>

                    <div>
                        <p> &emsp; Java programs are compromised of <strong>Classes</strong> and
                            <strong>Methods</strong>.
                            Methods are made up of series of <strong>Statements</strong>.</p>
                        </p>
                        <div>

                                <li>
                                    &ensp;A <u>statement</u> is a line of code that performs an operation. The example
                                    above
                                    uses a print statement to perform the task of outputting
                                    the phrase contained within the quotation (" ") to the display.
                                </li>
                                <br />
                                <li>
                                    &ensp;A <u>method</u> is a series of statements which perform a task and are
                                    combined
                                    within a single named function. Our print statement is within the medthod
                                    called <code>main</code> in the example above.<br /><br />
                                    &emsp; <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code><br /><br />
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    &ensp;A <u>class</u> is a collection of methods. The class name for the program
                                    above is
                                    called <code>Hello</code>. Class names begin with capital letters whereas method
                                    names
                                    begin with lowercase letters. The class names must match the file name.
                                </li>

                            &emsp; In order to store values we need to declare <strong>variables</strong>. Variables are
                            named locations where a given value is stored in. These values could be numbers, text, and
                            any
                            other
                            types of data. Variables are declared using different <strong>types</strong> which determine
                            what kind of values that variable can store. Here is an example of variable declaration:
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="code-div">
                        <code>char character;</code><br />
                        <code>String firstName;</code><br />
                        <code>int age;</code><br />
                        <code>boolean isTrue;</code>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            &emsp; There are four different types of variables that are declared in the above example:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                &ensp;Characters are declared using the keyword <code>char</code>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                &ensp;<code>String</code> keyword is used to store "strings" of characters. Some type
                                keywords are written with the first letter being uppercase. String is one of those
                                types. If
                                a variable
                                name consists of two words, as in our example above, then the words are joined together
                                and
                                the first letter of the first word is written in lowercase. The following words start
                                with
                                an uppercase
                                letter
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                &ensp;Integers are declared using the keyword <code>int</code>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                &ensp;Boolean values which are either <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>
                                are
                                declared using the keyword <code>boolean</code>.
                            </li>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            &emsp; We can assign values to our variables by using an <strong>assignment</strong>
                            statement.
                            We can assign values during the declaration or after. Here are some examples of assignment
                            statements:
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="code-div">
                        <code>String message = "Hello"; // Assigns the value "Hello" to the String variable named message</code><br />
                        <code>isTrue = true;  // gives the boolean variable isTrue the value of true</code>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            &emsp; Operations can be performed on certain types of variables by using
                            <strong>operators</strong>. Operators are symbols that represent simple computations. Here
                            is a
                            list of some of the operators that
                            Java uses to perform computations:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                &ensp;Addition => <code>+</code>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                &ensp;Subtraction => <code>-</code>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                &ensp;Multiplication => <code>*</code>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                &ensp;Division => <code>/</code>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                &ensp;Modulus => <code>%</code>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="code-div">
                            int x = 5;<br />
                            int y = 6;<br />
                            int sum = x + y;<br />
                            System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                &emsp; The above example is a demonstration of the addition "<code>+</code>" operator.
                                The
                                two variable, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, are declared and assigned integer
                                values. A
                                third variable named <code>sum</code>
                                is assigned the value of the sum of the values stored in the first two variables. We use
                                the
                                operator once again in our print statement, however, this time we are using it to
                                combine
                                our string text with the value stored in the sum variable.
                                This is called string <strong>concatenation</strong>. The resulting output will be:
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="code-output">
                            <code>The sum is: 11</code>
                        </div>

                            our
                            programs. This complexity could be achieved through the use of <strong>relational
                                operators</strong>. These operators are combined to form logic statements
                            that enable us to performs tasks with when certain conditions are met. Here is a list of
                            relational operators that are implemented by Java:
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="bulletless">
                                &ensp;<code>x == y &emsp; // x is equal to y</code>
                            </li>
                            <li class="bulletless">
                                &ensp;<code>x != y &emsp; // x is not equal to y</code>
                            </li>
                            <li class="bulletless">
                                &ensp;<code>x > y &emsp; // x is greater then y</code>
                            </li>
                            <li class="bulletless">
                                &ensp;<code>x < y &emsp; // x is less than y</code>
                            </li>
                            <li class="bulletless">
                                &ensp;<code>x >= y &emsp; // x is greater than or equal to y</code>
                            </li>
                            <li class="bulletless">
                                &ensp;<code>x <= y &emsp; // x is less than or equal to y</code>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            &emsp; Java has three <strong>logical operators</strong> that are used to combine different
                            relational operators. These operators are <code>&&</code>, <code>||</code>, and
                            <code>!</code>.
                            <code>&&</code> stands for the <i>and</i>, <code>||</code> for <i>or</i>,
                            and <code>!</code> stands for <i>not</i>. Lets look at an example of logical statements in
                            action:
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <ul class="bulletless">
                                <li class="bulletless">
                                    <code>( x > 4 ) && ( z != 0 ) </code>
                                </li>
                                <li class="bulletless">
                                    <code>( w == 2 ) || ( y < 8 )</code>
                                </li>
                                <li class="bulletless">
                                    <code>!( p == 5 )</code>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                &emsp; The first statement above is true if and only if both relational operators (those
                                within the parenthesis) are true. The second example returns a value that is true if at
                                least one of the relational operators is true. And the last example negates the truthy
                                value
                                of the relational operator. This means if the relational operator within the parenthesis
                                is
                                true then our final result is the opposite which is false and vice versa.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                &emsp; We are able to build upon these basic operators to form <strong>conditional
                                    statements</strong> in Java. In order to create conditional blocks of code we use a
                                combination of <i>if</i>, <i>else if</i>, and <i>else</i> statements. Here is an example
                                of
                                a simple block of
                                code that represents a conditional statement:
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="code-div">
                            <code>if ( x == 5 ) {<br/>
                                &emsp; System.out.println(" x is equal to 5 ");<br/>
                            }  else if ( x == 6 ) {<br/>
                                &emsp; System.out.println(" x is equal to 6 ");<br/>
                            }  else {<br/>
                                &emsp; System.out.println(" x is equal to 0 ");<br/>
                            }
                            </code>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                &emsp; We enter the conditional block by checking the first <i>if</i> statement. If the
                                condition within the parenthesis is true then we run the code within the brackets and
                                exit
                                the conditional block without checking the other conditions. If not, then we move on to
                                the
                                <i>else if</i> statement.
                                The same logic applies here as well. Finally if we haven't exited the conditional block
                                before the last <i>else</i> statement then the we will exit by running the code within
                                the
                                <i>else</i> block.

                            &emsp; In order to have an organized program that has a consistent delegation of task we
                            must
                            implement different <strong>methods</strong>. Java has libraries of its own that come with
                            their
                            own classes and methods. One such example is the <code>Math</code> class. This class has
                            methods
                            that you could
                            access and use within your code. When writing your own methods you must state the type of
                            <strong>return</strong> value the method will give back to the caller. You could opt out of
                            a
                            return value by using the keyword <code>void</code>. Void methods will perform tasks without
                            returning a value. If you would
                            like the return value to be an integer then you must use the keyword <code>int</code>, for
                            string <code>string</code>, and so on. You must also give each method a name. We follow the
                            same
                            rule as variable naming meaning if a method name is made up of more than one word then the
                            first
                            letter of the first word is
                            lowercase. The following words start with capital letters. No spaces allowed. And finally,
                            methods have <strong>parameters</strong>. The parameters are set when creating methods. You
                            could opt out and leave the parameter section blank. However, if you want your methods to
                            manipulate some data then you must
                            name the parameters. Here is a code snippet that demonstrates a simple method structure:
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="code-div">
                        <code>public static int sum( int x, int y ){<br/>
                            &emsp; int sum = x + y;<br/>
                            &emsp; return sum;
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            &emsp; The example above is method named <code>sum</code> that has two parameter arguments
                            that
                            are both integer and it returns an integer value back to the caller. When the method is
                            called,
                            the values that are sent into the method are given to the parameter arguments. When we enter
                            the
                            method, the values stored in
                            the parameter arguments are added and the total value is assigned to an integer called
                            <code>sum</code>. Then the keyword <code>return</code> is used to return the value of
                            <code>sum</code>.
